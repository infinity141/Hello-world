# Hello-world
Trying something new

hey guys it's me again trying something new again and wasting my time again but why i dunno anyway i'm learning how to type like a pro without looking at the keyboard. How is that for a change? i'm kinda enjoying this typing thing i dunno why but i do. i'm also getting a bit faster even without looking.

well now about my project: it's kinda good project but i think it requires a code. i'm really having fun here yo.
